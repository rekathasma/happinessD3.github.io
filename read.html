                    <p align="left" ><b> <font color="green">Introduction: </font> </b>We present an interactive visualization of the Happiness factor and other attributes determining the wellness of the countries in the world. The dataset shows the World Happiness factor for over a decade (2006-2016). We compared the data of 6 countries out of the dataset of 150 countries, using line charts in d3. The way we came up with these 6 countries was that we choose the country with the highest, lowest, medium happiness score. For instance, Norway has the highest Happiness Score while Central-African-Republic has the lowest in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> Happiness Factor: </font> </b> Happiness Factor is self-reported as the answer to the following question: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”. </p>
                    </p>
                    <p align="left"> <b> <font color="blue"> Other Factors:</font> </b> We took into account <b>GDP per capita, </b> <b>Healthy Life Expectancy, </b> <b>Social Support, </b> <b>Freedom</b> to make Life Choices,  <b>Confidence</b> in National Government </p>

                    <p align="left"> <b> <font color="green"> Development Process Overview: </font> </b> We did not had any prior D3.js experience. We spent around 3-4 hours daily for a week to learn and explore D3.js. Initially, we started off with a small dataset of wine reviews. We began exploring the basic visuals like pie chart, bar chart, line graph etc. for this small dataset. We moved on to more detailed and larger datasets to see how the visuals and various attributes would work. Then we added the interactivity to visuals, and play around with it to get hang of it. We also explored other datasets like: world chocolate ratings, most spoken languages of the world etc. Finally, we choose the World Happiness factor dataset to work on. This dataset was really interesting.The attributes it evaluates in determining the happiness factors are essential in determining any country's wellness and  growth. The dataset shows the World Happiness factor for over a decade (2006-2016). </p>
                    <p align="left"> <b> <font color="black"> Challenges: </font> </b> The most challenging task was to choose the correct visualization which represents the data in the best possible way. We spent lot of time trying out various visualizations like different graphs. It was even more challenging to add the interactivity. For the interaction to be self-explanatory we had to carefully choose the attributes which includes understanding the dataset in detail. </p>

                    <p align="left"> <b> 1. Individual data: </b> We used linechart to represent the dataset for 6 countries individually, which could be selected from a drop down box. This visualization can be seen from the <b> "Country Wise" </b> tab displayed on navigation bar Menu of our application. </p>
                    <p align="left">  <b> 2. Comparison of 6 countries: </b> We enhanced the above mentioned visualization to compare the factors for all the 6 countries parallely on a single page. This made the comparison of various happiness determining factors for all the countries much easier to comprehend and visualize. This visualization can be seen from the <b> "Home"</b> tab displayed on navigation bar Menu of our application. We made this as our main visualization for this dataset. </p>
                    <p align="left">  <b> 3. World Map: </b> We took the world happiness score records for the year 2015. We used the map to display the overall  picture of world happiness around the world. User can see happiness score by hovering over any country on the map. This visualization can be seen from the <b>"Map"</b> tab displayed on navigation bar Menu of our application. We made this as our main visualization for this dataset. </p>
